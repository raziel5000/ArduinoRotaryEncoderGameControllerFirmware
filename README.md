# Arduino-based game controller & packets manipulation
This source code enables real time input manipulation and packet trasmission between an Arduino-based game controller and my custom game engine.

The custom controller has a rotary encoder and a button. It just keeps on reading input from user and sending it as serial data packets. 

You can find both the Arduino firmware and the game engine function that receive and manipulate the incoming packets.
